# 🚀 Deploy AI-AMS Platform Without GitHub

## Easiest Method: Vercel CLI (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd "C:\Users\narayana\AI Projects\AIConsulting\ai-ams-platform"
```

### Step 3: Deploy!

```bash
vercel --prod
```

**What will happen:**
1. Vercel CLI will ask you to login (opens browser)
2. Login with your email/GitHub/GitLab account
3. Vercel will ask: "Set up and deploy?" → Press **Y**
4. "Which scope?" → Choose your account
5. "Link to existing project?" → Press **N**
6. "What's your project's name?" → Type: **ai-ams-platform**
7. "In which directory is your code located?" → Press **Enter** (current directory)
8. Vercel will detect Next.js automatically
9. "Want to override settings?" → Press **N**
10. Deploying... (~2 minutes)

**✅ You'll get a URL like:** `https://ai-ams-platform.vercel.app`

That's it! Share that URL with your leadership.
